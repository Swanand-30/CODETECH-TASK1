OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 
Project - LED BLINKING WITH ARDUINO.
Objective - The objective of this project is to control an LED connected to an Arduino Uno by making it blink at regular intervals. This simple project introduces basic concepts of digital output control, timing functions, and Arduino programming.

General Description:
In this project, an LED is connected to one of the digital pins of the Arduino Uno. The Arduino microcontroller will be programmed to turn the LED on and off at specified intervals, creating a blinking effect. The digitalWrite() function is used to set the state of the LED (HIGH to turn it on and LOW to turn it off), and the delay() function is used to control the timing between these states.

This project is an excellent starting point for beginners to understand how microcontrollers work, how to control output devices, and how to write simple programs in the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The concepts learned from this project can be applied to more complex tasks involving multiple LEDs, sensors, and other components.
